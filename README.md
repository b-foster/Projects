# Projects
The folders in this repository represent different projects or assignments I have done since beginning my master's in data science degree.

Many of the projects access APIs to pull data so may be unaccessible without your own API Key.

The ChuckNorrisJokes file provides a readable text program of various Chuck Norris Jokes, highlighting API and JSON requests. 
Alternatively, the jokeswithsound.py file within the folder offers users the ability to not only read the Chuck Norris jokes but hear them as well for some added functionality.

The Stock_Price_Analysis program I began in my last course and a project I continue to think about regarding improvements that can be made. Currently, it uses data from the AlphaVantage API and user input to analyze a company's stock performance of their choosing. Although it needs a lot of work to ever employ it in the real-world, it provides a few different perspectives into a stock with the use of 3 forecasting models to explore the future of a company's performance. I have used it as an analytical tool for a few personal investments but with a minuscule amount of money. It has not provided terrible results but something I would reuse as a short-term analytical tool rather than a long-term solution.

My most recent project was 

Next, the JSON_Store folder is a simple "store" program quickly written to show the uses of classes within python and creating a user interface within python.

Baseball_Analysis dives into baseball statistics to find the leading variables among winning teams and, specifically, World-Series Champions.
