# Projects
The folders in this repository represent different projects or assignments I have done since beginning my master's in data science degree.

Many projects access APIs to pull data so may be unaccessible without your own API Key.

The ChuckNorrisJokes file provides a readable text program of various Chuck Norris Jokes, highlighting API and JSON requests. 
Alternatively, the jokeswithsound.py file within the folder allows users to read the Chuck Norris jokes and hear them for some added functionality.

The Stock_Price_Analysis program I began in my last course and a project I continue to think about regarding improvements that can be made. Currently, it uses data from the AlphaVantage API and user input to analyze a company's stock performance of their choosing. Although it needs a lot of work to employ in the real world, it provides a few different perspectives on a stock using 3 forecasting models to explore the future of a company's performance. I have used it as an analytical tool for a few personal investments but with a minuscule amount of money. It has not provided terrible results but something I would reuse as a short-term analytical tool rather than a long-term solution.

My most recent project was Cancer_Patient_Analysis. Sadly, I could not include the data I used for the project in that folder. All the data I used was accessed on the _National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons Data Portal_, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/
This project was probably the most difficult due to the ridiculous percentage of unknowns that existed in the data.

Next, the JSON_Store folder is a simple "store" program quickly written to show the uses of classes within python and create a user interface within python. I created a small tennis gear and apparel inventory for users to "purchase."

Baseball_Analysis dives into baseball statistics to find the leading variables among winning teams and, specifically, World Series Champions. An early project I started in the program. This is a project I would like to revisit because the topic was fun and could easily transition into other sports and, if optimized, potentially into the sports betting scene, or fantasy football at the very least.
