Projects throughout my Data Science Masters Program

Hello and Welcome! This repository contains some projects throughout my Masters Program. 


If you are looking through the different projects, all should run fine with the exception of WEATHER.PY - this is due to API safety issues.
In order to accurately use weather.py, you will need to access an API_KEY from openweathermap.org; at which point, 
the program will be able to offer endless current weather details about the destination of your choosing.

The ChuckNorrisJokes file provides a readable text program of a variety of Chuck Norris Jokes, highlighting API requests and program structure. 
Alternatively, the jokeswithsound.py file within the folder offers users the ability to not only read the Chuck Norris jokes but hear them as well for some added functionality.

Next, the JSON_Store folder is a simple "store" program quickly written to show the uses of classes within python and creating a user interface within python
