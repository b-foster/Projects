# Projects
Projects I started during my Data Science Masters Program and continue to work on these.

Hello and Welcome! This repository contains a few projects I started and enjoyed the coursework and wanted to maintain the work and improve upon the results.


If you are looking through the different projects, all should run fine with the exception of the Weather_App and Stock Price Analysis programs - this is due to API safety issues.

In order to accurately use weather.py, you will need to access an API_KEY from openweathermap.org; at which point, 
the program will be able to offer endless current weather details about the destination of your choosing. For the Stock Price Analysis project, the AlphaVantage API would need to be utilized.

The ChuckNorrisJokes file provides a readable text program of a variety of Chuck Norris Jokes, highlighting API requests and program structure. 
Alternatively, the jokeswithsound.py file within the folder offers users the ability to not only read the Chuck Norris jokes but hear them as well for some added functionality.

Next, the JSON_Store folder is a simple "store" program quickly written to show the uses of classes within python and creating a user interface within python.

Baseball_Analysis dives into baseball statistics to find the leading variables among winning teams and, specifically, World-Series Champions.

The Stock Price Analysis program is currently my most recent project. It uses data from the AlphaVantage API and user input to analyze a company's stock of their choosing. Although it needs a lot of work to ever employ it in the real-world, it provides a few different perspectives into a stock with the use of 3 different forecasting models to explore the future of a company's performance.
